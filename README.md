# AWS Customer Support Classification (Demo Project)

## 🎯 Objective
Customer support teams receive many messages every day. 
The goal of this project is to use Machine Learning to automatically classify messages, helping agents respond faster.

## 🤖 Why Machine Learning?
Many support messages are repeated. ML can learn patterns in historical data and recommend categories, reducing manual work.

## 🛠 Approach
This demo uses AWS SageMaker Canvas to train and deploy a classification model without complex coding.

ML Lifecycle:
1. Business problem definition
2. Data preparation and labeling
3. Model training in SageMaker Canvas
4. Evaluation (precision, recall, confusion matrix)
5. Deployment endpoint

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- SageMaker Canvas
- Basic classification model

## 📈 Business Impact
- Faster routing of messages
- Lower response times
- Agents focus on complex tasks
- Less repetitive work
